Boostrap Notes


BUTTONS
___________________________________________________

Buttons are used in bootstrap to denote clickable texts which make it easy to establish buttons

"btn" "btn-block" and "btn-primary" "btn-info" are just some of the classes used. - predefined colors


Bootstrap comes with several pre-defined colors for buttons. The btn-danger class is the button color you'll use to notify users that the button performs a destructive action.
E.G. --- <button class="btn btn-block btn-danger">Delete</button>

BOOTSRAP GRID ELEMENTS
________________________________________________
Bootstrap uses a responsive 12 column grid system, which makes it easy to put elements into rows and specify each element's relative width.
Most of Bootstrap's classes can be applied to a div element.


You can use spans to create inline elements. Remember when we used the btn-block class to make the button fill the entire row.

Icons - Awsome Fonts
___________________________________________________
<i> fa fa-info</i> will add info to your element

You can add the fa-paper-plane Font Awesome icon by adding <i class="fa fa-paper-plane"></i> within your submit button element.

Responsively Style Checkboxes
________________________________________________________
You can use Bootstrap's col-xs-* classes on form elements, too!
This way, our checkboxes will be evenly spread out across the page, regardless of how wide the screen resolution is.


MOBILE RESPONSIVENESS
******************************************
Wrap elements within a div (e.g. - "container-fluid")

BOOTSTRAP WELLS
******************************************
Bootstrap has a class called well that can create a visual sense of depth for your columns.

Nest one div element with the class well within each of your col-xs-6 div elements.


JQUERY
*******************************************

You see how we made all of your button elements bounce? We selected them with $("button"), then we added some CSS classes to them with .addClass("animated bounce");.

You just used jQuery's .addClass() function, which allows you to add classes to elements.

BUTTON
______
For example, let's make all of your button elements bounce. Just add this code inside your document ready function:

$("button").addClass("animated bounce");

BY ELEMENT ID
_____________
Here's how you'd make the button element with the id target6 fade out:

$("#target6").addClass("animated fadeOut").


ALL SELECTORS
_______
You just used jQuery's .addClass() function, which allows you to add classes to elements.

First, let's target your div elements with the class well by using the $(".well") selector.



CSS
________

Here's how we would change its color to blue:

$("#target1").css("color", "blue");

This is slightly different from a normal CSS declaration, because the CSS property and its value are in quotes, and separated with a comma instead of a colon.
